# steamacci
This STEAM project is born of a group of enthusiastic teachers who want to prepare youth for the world that increasingly demands scientific and technological innovation, thoughtful design, and a focus on empathy; and a High School that is characterized by its continuous transformation and adaptation to the new teachings and demands of this society.
